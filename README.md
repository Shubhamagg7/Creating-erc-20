# Creating-erc-20
# start by creating an account on metamask for creatimg a metamask wallet on chrome
# connect your wallet to the https://20lab.app/ and generate the erc 20
# but first we have to take funds from any faucet
# i used the faucet https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/
# start mining and collect funds in the metamask wallet
# go back the 20lab website and add the required information for your erc token
# confirm your payment and now you can check your token being deployed on etherscan.io
